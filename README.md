# Talks

Tools for writing talks.

## File List

* `img_list.py` Search a TeX file for image files within 'includegraphics' commands and compare to files in the current directory to see which can be removed.
* `single_pdf.py` Combine multiple pdfs into a single file. (Useful for proposals which lack TeX templates).
